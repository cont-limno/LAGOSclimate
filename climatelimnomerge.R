#merging limno data and climate data into a single table for Shuai to use.  horizontal format here, but could switch to vertical if needed?

#merge by hu12, include all limno data but only include climate data for years where we have limno data for years and lakes where we have data for at least one limno variable (secchi tp or chla)
